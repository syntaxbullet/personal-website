# Syntaxbullet - My personal Website

This is a simple Vite + Typescript + React project for my personal website. 
[Figma Design File](https://www.figma.com/file/v7hFF0SRkCs3EgFJgOQIvi/Personal-Website?type=design&node-id=3%3A130&mode=design&t=FBGK6WNC6LJqhIMr-1)

## This branch currently shows a previous design
I have recently made an effort to re-design the existing page within figma, the design file can be found above, but beware that at the current point in time the code does not reflect the state of the new figma design at all.

### Roadmap 
- [ ] Finish Figma Design
- [ ] Implement Resume / CV Page
- [ ] Write first blog article
